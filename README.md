 The Odin Project: HTML Foundations - 6. Links and Images

# odin-links-and-images directory
Worked though the html_foundations_6 unit and made a main index.html page that linked to an about.html page in another directory. Also, added an image to display. It's the same image linked both with a website and a file. There wasn't much here, but decided to publish it anyway, because I am doing this with all the work through The Odin Project.
